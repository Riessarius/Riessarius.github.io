## Research Experiences

- **Mar. 2023 - Now**
  - **Research in Computational Cognitive Science**
  - Advisor: Dr. Marcelo Mattar (New York University)
    - Analyzed atypical human decision-making behavior during a two-arm bandit task using tiny recurrent neural networks and dynamical systems methodologies.
    - Discovered novel cognitive decision-making strategies that conventional modeling techniques could not capture.
    - Developed diagnostic classifiers based on these interpretable cognitive strategies, achieving predictive performance on par with more complex but less interpretable neural network models.

- **Jan. 2020 - Dec. 2020**
  - **Research in Architecture Engineering**
  - Advisor: Dr. Yong Yang (Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences)
    - Conceptualized the architectural framework for a cybernetic system responsible for controlling EAST, a notable Chinese tokamak.
    - Developed a prototype, ensuring a robust structure that facilitated reliable communication between decentralized cybernetic units with high performance.

- **Nov. 2019 - Jun. 2021**
  - **Research in Cognitive Neuroscience**
  - Advisor: Dr. Xiaochu Zhang (University of Science and Technology of China)
    - Collected electrophysiological data from methamphetamine-addicted individuals undergoing neurofeedback interventions.
    - Efficiently enhanced the neurofeedback protocol for withdrawal of methamphetamine addiction.
    - Introduced a reinforcement learning model that can track the progress of neurofeedback training.
